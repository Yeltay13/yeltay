Hi there!

I’m Yeltay, and I specialize in empowering IT professionals by enhancing their soft skills to accelerate their career growth. With a passion for teaching, I not only help you gain confidence in speaking foreign languages but also assist in honing the essential soft skills needed in the tech industry.

What sets me apart? I love coding just as much as I love teaching. This unique blend allows me to understand the specific challenges faced by tech professionals and tailor my training to meet those needs effectively.

Whether you're looking to communicate more effectively in your workplace, lead with confidence, or simply expand your career opportunities by becoming more versatile in a foreign language, I’m here to guide you every step of the way.
